## 📊 **Data Architecture**

### **1. Cloudflare Workers API (Primary Data Source)**
**Base URL**: `https://missionary-profiles-api.jbr01061981.workers.dev`

**Endpoints:**
```
GET /health                    # API health status
GET /api/profiles              # Paginated missionary list
GET /api/profile/{id}          # Individual missionary profile
GET /api/search/{query}        # Full-text search
GET /api/locations             # Mission field coordinates
```

**Enhanced Data Model:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedMissionary {
  id: string
  name: string
  displayName: string
  dates: { birth?: number, death?: number, display: string }
  image?: string
  images: string[]
  summary: string
  biography: BiographySection[]
  timeline: TimelineEvent[]
  locations: MissionaryLocation[]
  categories: string[]
  quiz: QuizQuestion[]
  achievements: string[]
  source: 'wikimedia' | 'github' | 'custom'
  sourceUrl: string
  attribution: string
  lastModified: string
  lang: string
}
```

### **2. Firebase (User Management Only)**
**Collections:**
```
users/{uid} → {
  role: 'user' | 'curator' | 'admin'
  displayName: string
  email: string
  createdAt: timestamp
  preferences: object
}

favorites/{uid}/items/{mid} → {
  addedAt: timestamp
  missionaryId: string
  missionaryName: string
}

contributions/{id} → {
  missionaryId: string
  type: 'photo' | 'anecdote'
  content: string | imageUrl
  caption: string
  contributedBy: uid
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
  submittedAt: timestamp
}
```

### **3. Local Cache Strategy**
**Cache Types & TTL:**
- **Profiles**: 24 hours (individual missionary data)
- **Profile Lists**: 12 hours (paginated directory data)
- **Search Results**: 6 hours (search query responses)
- **Locations**: 48 hours (mission field coordinates)
- **User Preferences**: Persistent (favorites, settings)

**Storage Implementation:**
```dart
// Hive Boxes (Structured Data)
Box<String> missionaryBox     # Individual profiles
Box<String> profilesListBox   # Directory listings
Box<String> searchBox         # Search results
Box<String> locationsBox      # Mission coordinates

// SharedPreferences (User Data)
favorites, settings, search_history, user_preferences
```

## 🎨 **Spiritual UI Language System**

### **Core Concept**
Transform standard app terminology into inspiring biblical/spiritual language.

**Key Transformations:**
| Standard | Spiritual Enhanced |
|----------|-------------------|
| Login | "Enter the Fellowship" |
| Search | "Seek Among Saints" |
| Home | "Fellowship Hall" |
| Profile | "Witness Their Testament" |
| Favorites | "Treasured Saints" |
| Loading... | "Gathering Testimonies..." |
| Read More | "Continue the Journey" |
| Share | "Spread the Word" |
| Settings | "Prepare Your Heart" |
| About | "Our Calling" |

**Implementation:**
```dart
class SpiritualStrings {
  static const String searchHint = 'Seek faithful servants...';
  static const String faithfulServants = 'Faithful Servants';
  static const String seekAgain = 'Seek Again';
  
  // Dynamic loading messages
  static String get randomLoadingMessage => // Rotates spiritual messages
}
```
